# Personalized Information Retrieval for IOT Tweets

The purpose of this project is to analyze and evaluate user feedback on IOT through tweets.
For this, we build a user profile and offer two tools: a custom tweets access engine on the #IoT (as well as influencers related to the topic of the query), and a recommendation system for tweets and authors related to his profile.
